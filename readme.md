### **Description:**
This interactive web map visualizes the USAID Country Roadmap dataset for FY25. The dataset comprises 18 third-party metrics divided into two dimensions that assess a country’s commitment and capacity to make progress toward sustainable development. It also includes two additional metrics outside of these dimensions that provide further context on a country’s progress toward sustainable development. Previously, this dataset was presented as static webpages and PDFs with dot plot and scatterplot graphs. This project aims to enhance the user experience by incorporating interactive geospatial visualization for more targeted comparative analysis.

This project was created in my personal capacity as a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and does not represent the views of my employer.
