Commitment,Commitment,N/A,"The degree to which a country's laws, policies, actions, and informal governance mechanisms - such as cultures and norms - support progress towards self-reliance. Overall ""Commitment"" composite estimate is calculated using the arithmetic mean of all available scaled components for each country. The Commitment Index comprises eight underlying metrics, each receiving an equal weight (i.e. one-eighth weighting, if all sub-components are present after imputation). If dimension components (i.e. individual metrics) are missing after imputation, the Commitment score is still generated using an arithmetic mean of all available components, but only when at least five of eight Commitment metrics are present.","USAID, 'FY 2024 USAID Country Roadmap Methodology Guide', August 2023."
Capacity,Capacity,N/A,"How far a country has come in its ability to manage its own development journey across the dimensions of political, social, and economic development, including the ability to work across these sectors. Overall ""Capacity"" composite estimate is calculated using the arithmetic mean of all available scaled components for each country. The Capacity Index comprises ten underlying metrics, each receiving an equal weight (i.e. one-tenth weighting, if all sub-components are present after imputation). If dimension components (i.e. individual metrics) are missing after imputation, the Capacity score is still generated using an arithmetic mean of all available components, but only when at least six of ten Capacity metrics are present.","USAID, 'FY 2024 USAID Country Roadmap Methodology Guide', August 2023."
