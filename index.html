                <h2>Welcome to the Country Roadmaps Interactive Map</h2>
                <p>Each year since 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) releases its Country Roadmaps, an analytical tool for assessing global development progress. These roadmaps use 18 third-party metrics to evaluate all low- and middle-income countries. The metrics are organized into two dimensions:</p>
                <li><b>Commitment:</b> Measures how a country’s laws, policies, actions, and informal governance mechanisms support sustainable development.</li>
                <li><b>Capacity:</b> Assesses a country’s ability to plan, finance, and manage its own political, social, and economic development, including cross-sector collaboration.</li>
                <p></p>
                <p>Additionally, there are two extra metrics for informational purposes: fragility and risk of external debt distress. These do not affect the Commitment or Capacity scores.</p>
                <p>This interactive web map visualizes the USAID Country Roadmap dataset for Fiscal Year 2025. Previously, this dataset was presented as static webpages and PDFs with dot plot and 
                    scatterplot graphs at <a href="https://roadmaps.usaid.gov">https://roadmaps.usaid.gov.</a> This project aims to enhance the user experience by incorporating interactive geospatial visualization for more targeted 
                    comparative analysis. Users can hover over and click on different countries and buttons to explore the dataset. For more information, click the “help” button at the top 
                    right of the web page.</p>

                        The dataset comprises 18 third-party metrics for all low- and middle-income countries divided 
                        into two dimensions that assess a country’s commitment and capacity to make progress toward sustainable 
                        development. It also includes two additional metrics outside of these dimensions that provide further 
                        context on a country’s progress toward sustainable development. Previously, this dataset was presented

                <h3>Map</h3>
                <p>This interactive map has three types of layers you can toggle using the buttons below the map:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Capacity and Commitment:</b> Displays combined overall Capacity and Commitment scores for each country using a color-coded legend. The legend shows nine colors representing different combinations of low and high capacity and commitment.</li>
                    <li><b>Metrics Maps:</b> Shows individual scores for each metric under the Capacity and Commitment dimensions as color-coded maps. You can toggle these layers on and off.</li>
                    <li><b>Proportional Symbols:</b> Adds symbols to represent the Fragility and Risk of External Debt Distress metrics for each country. These symbols can be viewed on top of the metrics maps, allowing you to see both the color-coded scores and the proportional symbols simultaneously.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Metrics</h3>
                <p>Hover over the buttons to see definitions and data sources for each metric. Hover over a country on the map to see the country's score for the selected metric. A score of 0.0 on a metric means the country had the least favorable outcome globally, while a score of 1.0 means
                     the most favorable outcome. Other countries receive scores between 0.0 and 1.0 based on their position between the worst and best outcomes, maintaining the original data distribution. 
                     Although USAID Roadmaps focus on low- and middle-income countries, the range of outcomes includes all countries globally, including high-income countries.</p>
                <h3>Graphs</h3>
                <p>Click on a country to open an info window:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Left Side:</b> Displays the country's name and scores on each metric under the Capacity and Commitment dimensions as dot plots on a range of 0.0 (worst outcome) to 1.0 (best outcome). These plots compare the country's scores to other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and show the average score for all LMICs.</li>
                    <li><b>Right Side:</b> Shows a scatterplot of overall capacity and commitment scores for all LMICs, highlighting the selected country. You can hover over dots to see country names, click to highlight a country on the map, or lasso select multiple dots to highlight them. Close the window by clicking the X in the upper right corner.</li>
